Inventory Management App

This project is an Inventory Management Application designed to help manage products across various categories for an imaginary store. The application allows users to navigate through different categories, view all items within those categories, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both items and categories. Each item in the inventory includes details such as name, description, category affiliation, price, stock quantity, and a URL for more information. Categories are defined with a name, description, and URL.
